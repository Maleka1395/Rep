Repo created instantly with Node.js.

This repository was automatically created using a Node.js script.  
It serves as a simple example of how automation can be used to quickly set up new GitHub projects.
 Features
- Auto-generated repository using GitHub API.
- Initialized with a basic `README.md`.
- Ready to be extended with code, documentation, or tests.

How it works
The repository was created by running a Node.js script that:
1. Connects to the GitHub API with a personal access token.
2. Creates a new repository under the specified account or organization.
3. Initializes a local Git project and links it to the remote repository.
4. Adds a starter `README.md` file and makes the initial commit.

Next Steps
- Add your project files inside the repository.
- Extend the documentation as your project
- 
- Use this workflow to bootstrap future projects faster.
  
Basic repo from Node.js tool.


This repository is the central hub for the Node.js automation script that streamlines GitHub repository creation.  
It not only initializes new repositories quickly but also provides a structured foundation for all future projects.

### Repository Structure
- `create-repo.js` â€“ The main script that interacts with the GitHub API and performs local Git initialization.
- `README.md` â€“ Starter documentation generated automatically.
- `.gitignore` â€“ Basic Node.js ignore patterns for dependencies and environment files.
- `src/` â€“ Intended directory for source code of new projects.
- `tests/` â€“ Folder for adding automated tests.
- `docs/` â€“ Optional folder for extended documentation.

### Advanced Features
- Supports creating repositories under both personal accounts and organizations.
- Handles both public and private repositories with a simple flag (`--private`).
- Initializes local Git repository, adds remote, and pushes initial commit automatically.
- Can be extended to include custom templates, license files, or additional boilerplate.

### Workflow
1. Set your GitHub personal access token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
2. Run the script with the repository name, optional owner, and `--private` flag if needed.
3. The script will:

- Handles both public and private repositories with a simple `--private` flag.
- Initializes local Git repository, adds remote, and pushes the initial commit automatically.
- Can be extended to include custom templates, licenses, or additional boilerplate files.

### Workflow Overview
1. Set your GitHub personal access token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Repo created by automation.

Created in seconds with Node.

Generated by Node.js automation.


Repo created instantly with Node.js.

This repository was automatically created using a Node.js script.  
It serves as a simple example of how automation can be used to quickly set up new GitHub projects.
 Features
- Auto-generated repository using GitHub API.
- Initialized with a basic `README.md`.
- Ready to be extended with code, documentation, or tests.

How it works
The repository was created by running a Node.js script that:
1. Connects to the GitHub API with a personal access token.
2. Creates a new repository under the specified account or organization.
3. Initializes a local Git project and links it to the remote repository.
4. Adds a starter `README.md` file and makes the initial commit.

Next Steps
- Add your project files inside the repository.
- Extend the documentation as your project
- 
- Use this workflow to bootstrap future projects faster.
  
Basic repo from Node.js tool.


This repository is the central hub for the Node.js automation script that streamlines GitHub repository creation.  
It not only initializes new repositories quickly but also provides a structured foundation for all future projects.

### Repository Structure
- `create-repo.js` – The main script that interacts with the GitHub API and performs local Git initialization.
- `README.md` – Starter documentation generated automatically.
- `.gitignore` – Basic Node.js ignore patterns for dependencies and environment files.
- `src/` – Intended directory for source code of new projects.
- `tests/` – Folder for adding automated tests.
- `docs/` – Optional folder for extended documentation.

### Advanced Features
- Supports creating repositories under both personal accounts and organizations.
- Handles both public and private repositories with a simple flag (`--private`).
- Initializes local Git repository, adds remote, and pushes initial commit automatically.
- Can be extended to include custom templates, license files, or additional boilerplate.

### Workflow
1. Set your GitHub personal access token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
2. Run the script with the repository name, optional owner, and `--private` flag if needed.
3. The script will:

- `README.md` – Starter documentation automatically generated for new repositories.
- `.gitignore` – Basic Node.js ignore patterns for dependencies and environment files.
- `src/` – Suggested folder for source code of new projects.
- `tests/` – Folder for adding automated tests.
- `docs/` – Optional folder for extended documentation or guides.

### Advanced Features
- Supports creating repositories under personal accounts or organizations.
- Handles both public and private repositories with a simple `--private` flag.
- Initializes local Git repository, adds remote, and pushes the initial commit automatically.
- Can be extended to include custom templates, licenses, or additional boilerplate files.

### Workflow Overview
1. Set your GitHub personal access token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
2. Run the script with the repository name, optional owner, and `--private` flag if needed:
   ```bash
   node create-repo.js <repo-name> [owner] [--private]
# GitHub Repo Creator (Node.js)

A Node.js automation tool for creating and initializing GitHub repositories directly from the command line.  
This script connects to the GitHub API, generates a new repository, and sets up a ready-to-use local project folder.

# Repo Template Generator

A Node.js-based tool that automates the creation of project templates.  
It allows developers to quickly scaffold new repositories with predefined structures, files, and configurations.

---

## 🚀 Overview
The **Repo Template Generator** complements the main GitHub automation script by enabling users to generate ready-to-use project templates before pushing them to GitHub.  
This helps developers save time and maintain consistent standards across multiple repositories.

# Repo Auto Docs

An automated documentation generator for GitHub repositories.  
This tool scans project files and creates clean, standardized README and documentation files automatically — saving developers valuable time.

---

## 🚀 Overview
**Repo Auto Docs** works alongside your other automation tools — such as **Repo Creator**, **Template Generator**, and **Setup CLI** —  
to automatically generate or update project documentation based on repository content and metadata.

With just one command, it analyzes your codebase, detects key files, and produces clear, readable documentation in Markdown format.

---

##Features
- Automatically generate `README.md` and `docs/` folder documentation.
- Extracts information from:
  - `package.json` (Node.js projects)
  - Project metadata and folder structure
  - Code comments and headers
- Generates changelogs and feature lists dynamically.
- Keeps existing README files up to date.
- Supports multiple languages and frameworks
## 🧩 Why Repo Auto Docs Matters

Maintaining consistent and high-quality documentation across multiple repositories is often time-consuming and error-prone.  
**Repo Auto Docs** solves this problem by providing a fully automated system that keeps your documentation clean, readable, and always up-to-date.

By integrating with the other tools in the GitHub Automation Toolkit, this repository ensures that every new project you create doesn't just start with clean code — but also with complete, organized, and professional documentation.
